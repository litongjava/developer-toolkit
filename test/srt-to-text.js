const srtContent = `1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,909
one of the biggest challenges facing not

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:05,460
just business owners but everyone is the

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,780
loss of time and money due to

4
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,340
multitasking in this video I'm going to

5
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,849
revisit my popular myth of multitasking

6
00:00:13,849 --> 00:00:17,160
exercise I'm Dave Crenshaw and this is

7
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,240
chaos

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,130
vs. entrepreneur now in my book the myth

9
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:25,010
of multitasking I explained that

10
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:26,730
multitasking is really just a

11
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,609
non-existent word what really happens is

12
00:00:29,609 --> 00:00:32,308
either background tasking or switch

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,770
tasking to save time on this video I'm

14
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,809
going to put the definition of each

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:39,899
below this video what you need to know

16
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,270
though is that switch tasking which most

17
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:43,680
people think of when they say

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,340
multitasking is a thief it is a thief of

19
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,070
time it is a thief of money it is a

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,010
thief of your sanity and you're going to

21
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:55,710
experience firsthand what I mean in this

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:57,719
little exercise now you'll need to

23
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,379
download and print out the exercise PDF

24
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:03,719
that we have on this page or if that's

25
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:05,519
too hard to do you can simply take a

26
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,340
piece of paper turn it sideways and draw

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,860
three lines across it so that you have a

28
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:13,619
piece of paper with four rows now what

29
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,140
we're going to do is a timed exercise so

30
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:19,020
don't start until I say go you're going

31
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,960
to recopy in the first row the phrase

32
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,430
switch tasking is a thief and then in

33
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:28,560
the second row you're just going to

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,549
write the numbers 1 through 21 so we're

35
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:33,930
going to time this together

36
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,680
get your paper and your pencil ready get

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,210
set and go

38
00:01:44,030 --> 00:02:00,260
five seconds ten seconds fifteen twenty

39
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:09,800
will go ten more twenty five and third

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,810
okay most people should be done by this

41
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:14,630
point now write down your approximate

42
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:17,150
time now we're going to do this again

43
00:02:17,150 --> 00:02:18,800
but we're going to simulate switch

44
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,450
tasking which is trying to perform

45
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,880
multiple active tasks at the same time

46
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,280
such as talking on the phone while

47
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,070
answering email you're going to again

48
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,500
recopy in the third row the phrase

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:35,030
switch tasking is a thief but for every

50
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,459
letter that you write you're going to

51
00:02:37,459 --> 00:02:40,850
write a number in the fourth row so you

52
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:45,800
will write s and then one and then W and

53
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:49,130
then two and so on until you complete

54
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,110
the phrase switch tasking is a thief and

55
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,900
the numbers 1 through 21 get your paper

56
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,580
and your pencil ready we're going to

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,870
time this again

58
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:08,230
get ready get set and go five seconds

59
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:31,430
10 seconds 15 20 25 30 this is where we

60
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:47,950
were when we stopped last time 35 40 45

61
00:03:49,690 --> 00:04:00,860
50 seconds we'll go 10 more 55 and 60

62
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,980
and stop there if you don't have it done

63
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,739
just give up you've experienced the

64
00:04:06,739 --> 00:04:10,130
three effects of switch tasking number

65
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,739
one the amount of time it takes to

66
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:16,100
complete things increases in some of

67
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,039
your cases up to twice as long as the

68
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,160
first time number two the quality of the

69
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,890
work decreases take a look at the two

70
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,720
different times you wrote these phrases

71
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:29,660
and numbers some of you ended up on a

72
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,030
number other than 21 some of you started

73
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,710
to switch which row you were writing

74
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,810
some of you just had bad handwriting

75
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,140
but it decreases the quality in business

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,419
this causes the business to lose money

77
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:43,910
through mistakes and the number three

78
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,380
you might have to think about this a bit

79
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,870
but if you consider the first time in

80
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,220
the second time you'll realize that the

81
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,830
second time most of you experienced much

82
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:56,030
more stress all of these costs make

83
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:58,760
switch tasking a thief and it is

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,310
something to be avoided and so I would

85
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,229
like to ask you this question to wrap up

86
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:05,150
the video what's one thing you're going

87
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,419
to do today to make sure that you focus

88
00:05:08,419 --> 00:05:10,580
while you're working on your tasks

89
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:12,620
rather than switch tasking please

90
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,600
comment below and also if you've got a

91
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,190
question you'd like me to answer in a

92
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,650
future edition of Kaos vs. entrepreneur

93
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,080
please ask that below as well thanks for

94
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,080
watching

95
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,490
stay focused`;
